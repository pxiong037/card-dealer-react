# dad-jokes-react
This application was created using create-react-app. The application uses the api https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle to request for a deck. Each time the user clicks the button to give themselves a card, a request is made to the api https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/${deck_id}/draw/ to draw a random card from the existing deck. Once all cards have been drawn the user will be alerted that there are no cards left in the deck.
